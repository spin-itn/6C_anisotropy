# 6Canisotropy
The code provides an example of real data to estimate the phase velocity from one earthquake. It is used to analysis the seismic anisotropy from 6C observations based on the proposed new method.

The theory paper "Le Tang, Heiner Igel, and Jean-Paul Montagner. Single-Point Dispersion Measurement of Surface Waves Combining Translation, Rotation and Strain in Weakly
Anisotropic Media: Theory" has been submitted to GJI.

"Rot_x.mseed, Rot_y.mseed, Rot_z.mseed, Tra_x.mseed, Tra_y.mseed, Tra_z.mseed" : 6C data

"california_data.ipynb " is used to retrieve the earthquke 6C data based on ADR (Array Derived Rotation) method.

"california_code.m, cwt_cmor.m, est_azimuth.m est_disp.m " are used to estimate the phase velocity and azimuth.
